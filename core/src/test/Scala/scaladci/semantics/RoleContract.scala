  /*
  Role contracts (or "Role-object contracts")

  For an object to play a Role it needs to satisfy a Role contract that defines
  what methods the Role expect it to have before they can merge to a Role player.
  We call those methods in the object class "instance methods".

  When our Role players start to interact at runtime they will call these methods
  on each other. To maximise our ability to reason about the expected outcome of
  those interactions we therefore need to know what the instance methods do too
  to various extends depending on their nature (we don't need to lookup what
  `toString` does for instance).


  Types - precise but not a silver bullet always...

  One way to know the object's methods is of course to know the objects type.
  We can look at the method definition in the defining class (the objects type)
  and see what it does.

  But what if we get an object that is a subtype of the type we have defined
  in our Role contract? The method could have been overriden and now do nasty
  things that would give us nasty surprises once we run our program.

  Fortunately we can enforce an even more specific type equalling the expected
  type (avoiding subclasses thereof). But even that specific type might in turn
  depend on other classes that could have been subclasses and so on. That seems
  to suggest that we will never be able to reason with 100% certainty about
  the outcome of our program at runtime - unless we define all object classes
  ourselves.


  Structural types (duck typing) - flexible but unpredictable...

  When a Role is more flexible and wants to allow a broader set of objects
  to be able to play it, then a structural type (a la duck-typing) will come
  in handy. The role contract would then define what method signature(s) a
  Role expects. The backside of that coin is of course that we would know
  much less about what those methods do.


  Levels of predictability:

  1) One and only type (enforced with type equality)
  2) Type (could be any subtype too)
  3) Structural type (duck-typing)
