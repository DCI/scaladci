ATTENTION!

The examples in this role_object package are not complying to DCI!

Instead of having a data object playing a role, we here experiment
with using a "role object" instead. The role object is simply a
collection of static "role methods" that has a role name.

Data and Role are here separate instances so no behavior in the
form of role methods is "added" to the data instance. The role
object here simply works with a data object.

Some of the standard examples where converted to this approach
to see how that would compare to real DCI.

The examples use standard Scala and no macro transformation.
